# Project Title
Integration and Development of energy efficient service oriented IoT applications system using LoRaWAN and Unmanned Area Vehicles.

## IoT Drone
The Internet of Things allows people and things to be connected Anytime, Anyplace, with Anything and Anyone, ideally using Any path/network and Any service.
Drones are an emerging form of new IoT devices, flying in the sky with full network connectivity. 
Through edge computing embedded system drone data can be monitored and stored in cloud computing for IoT system. UAVs or drones work dynamically for such an IoT scenario that collects the data and communicates
it to other devices that are out of the communication ranges. The unique benefits of the drone over IoT include deployment at remote locations, the ability to carry flexible payloads,
reprogrammability during tasks, and ability to sense for anything from anywhere.

## Background
In present days one of the most signoficant challenges of UAV IoT newrodk is "Energy-aware applications for UAV". For having more energy efficient 
data transmission, LPWAN (Long Power Wide Area Network) was integrated, which allows long communication distance with low power and that can prolong the flight time of drone and LPWAN includes LoRaWAN. LoRa devices and wireless
radio frequency technology is a long range, low power wireless platform that has become crucial technology factor for IoT networks worldwide. For innovate IoT application, real-time air quality monitoring was used.

## Objectives
1. Air quality monitoring sensory data collection system acquisition.
2. Communication between Drone end node and application server through gateway and network server.
3. Sensors equipped drone that measures the air environmental quality data and sends the data of minimum 10 different locations via a LoRaWAN Interface located in the drone to a LoRaWAN Gateway. Manually driven drone takes data twice from each
location in different flights.
4. Sensory data will be stored in an appropriate application server.
5. Customize data storage for long term.

## Experimental Harware Development for embedded IoT
Hardware: Components, microcontroller and electrical connections were soldered and developed for the compatibility of embedded IoT Drone hardware development. For this project hardware development following components have been used such as: Drone, LoRa Microcontroller board, Air Quality Sensor, Raspberry Pi Linux gateway.

## Drone
For edge computing as LoRa end node, the components of an autonomous drone from scratch has been described here: https://github.com/Shakir74/IoT_Drone/blob/main/Drone%20Building
 and after hardware development final IoT Drone view is as following
